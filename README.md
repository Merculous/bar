# About
This is just a simple progress bar (not my implementation), which will soon
be updated with features that pv has such as time elapsed, how much data is
being read/written on average, and etc.

# TODO
- Have the progress ('-') allow the bar to work with data being passed in (cat)
- Reading and writing with std(in/out/err)
- Make the script work similar to how pv works (end goal)
- Rewrite the whole progress bar code so nothing is made by anyone else
